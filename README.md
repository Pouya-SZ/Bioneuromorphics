# Bioneuromorphics
Neuromorphic-compatible neural network for the recognition of COPD and HC samples


The Exasens dataset includes demographic information on 4 groups of saliva samples (COPD-HC-Asthma-Infected) 
collected in the frame of a joint research project, Exasens (https://www.leibniz-healthtech.de/en/research/projects/bmbf-project-exasens/),
at the Research Center Borstel, BioMaterialBank Nord (Borstel, Germany). 
The sampling procedure of the patient materials was approved by the local ethics committee of the University of Luebeck under 
the approval number AZ-16-167 and a written informed consent was obtained from all subjects. A permittivity biosensor,
developed at IHP Microelectronics (Frankfurt Oder, Germany), was used for the dielectric characterization of the saliva samples for
classification purposes (https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare7010011).

In case of using the proposed Few-Shot Learning methods or the Exasens dataset, please refer to the following papers:
